DESCRIPTION
    This is an early release which might be useful, but hasn't seen much
    testing.

  OpenCL FROM 10000 FEET HEIGHT
    Here is a high level overview of OpenCL:

    First you need to find one or more OpenCL::Platforms (kind of like
    vendors) - usually there is only one.

    Each platform gives you access to a number of OpenCL::Device objects,
    e.g. your graphics card.

    From a platform and some device(s), you create an OpenCL::Context, which
    is a very central object in OpenCL: Once you have a context you can
    create most other objects:

    OpenCL::Program objects, which store source code and, after building for
    a specific device ("compiling and linking"), also binary programs. For
    each kernel function in a program you can then create an OpenCL::Kernel
    object which represents basically a function call with argument values.

    OpenCL::Memory objects of various flavours: OpenCL::Buffer objects (flat
    memory areas, think arrays or structs) and OpenCL::Image objects (think
    2d or 3d array) for bulk data and input and output for kernels.

    OpenCL::Sampler objects, which are kind of like texture filter modes in
    OpenGL.

    OpenCL::Queue objects - command queues, which allow you to submit memory
    reads, writes and copies, as well as kernel calls to your devices. They
    also offer a variety of methods to synchronise request execution, for
    example with barriers or OpenCL::Event objects.

    OpenCL::Event objects are used to signal when something is complete.

  HELPFUL RESOURCES
    The OpenCL spec used to develop this module (1.2 spec was available, but
    no implementation was available to me :).

    If you are into UML class diagrams, the following diagram might help -
    if not, it will be mildly cobfusing:

    Here's a tutorial from AMD (very AMD-centric, too), not sure how useful
    it is, but at least it's free of charge:

BASIC WORKFLOW
    To get something done, you basically have to do this once (refer to the
    examples below for actual code, this is just a high-level description):

    Find some platform (e.g. the first one) and some device(s) (e.g. the
    first device of the platform), and create a context from those.

    Create program objects from your OpenCL source code, then build
    (compile) the programs for each device you want to run them on.

    Create kernel objects for all kernels you want to use (surprisingly,
    these are not device-specific).

    Then, to execute stuff, you repeat these steps, possibly resuing or
    sharing some buffers:

    Create some input and output buffers from your context. Set these as
    arguments to your kernel.

    Enqueue buffer writes to initialise your input buffers (when not
    initialised at creation time).

    Enqueue the kernel execution.

    Enqueue buffer reads for your output buffer to read results.

EXAMPLES
  Enumerate all devices and get contexts for them.
    Best run this once to get a feel for the platforms and devices in your
    system.

       for my $platform (OpenCL::platforms) {
          printf "platform: %s\n", $platform->name;
          printf "extensions: %s\n", $platform->extensions;
          for my $device ($platform->devices) {
             printf "+ device: %s\n", $device->name;
             my $ctx = $platform->context (undef, [$device]);
             # do stuff
          }
       }

  Get a useful context and a command queue.
    This is a useful boilerplate for any OpenCL program that only wants to
    use one device,

       my ($platform) = OpenCL::platforms; # find first platform
       my ($dev) = $platform->devices;     # find first device of platform
       my $ctx = $platform->context (undef, [$dev]); # create context out of those
       my $queue = $ctx->queue ($dev);     # create a command queue for the device

  Print all supported image formats of a context.
    Best run this once for your context, to see whats available and how to
    gather information.

       for my $type (OpenCL::MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE2D, OpenCL::MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE3D) {
          print "supported image formats for ", OpenCL::enum2str $type, "\n";
      
          for my $f ($ctx->supported_image_formats (0, $type)) {
             printf "  %-10s %-20s\n", OpenCL::enum2str $f->[0], OpenCL::enum2str $f->[1];
          }
       }

  Create a buffer with some predefined data, read it back synchronously,
then asynchronously.
       my $buf = $ctx->buffer_sv (OpenCL::MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR, "helmut");

       $queue->enqueue_read_buffer ($buf, 1, 1, 3, my $data);
       print "$data\n";

       my $ev = $queue->enqueue_read_buffer ($buf, 0, 1, 3, my $data);
       $ev->wait;
       print "$data\n"; # prints "elm"

  Create and build a program, then create a kernel out of one of its
functions.
       my $src = '
          kernel void
          squareit (global float *input, global float *output)
          {
            $id = get_global_id (0);
            output [id] = input [id] * input [id];
          }
       ';

       my $prog = $ctx->program_with_source ($src);

       # build croaks on compile errors, so catch it and print the compile errors
       eval { $prog->build ($dev, "-cl-fast-relaxed-math"); 1 }
          or die $prog->build_log;

       my $kernel = $prog->kernel ("squareit");

  Create some input and output float buffers, then call the
'squareit' kernel on them.
       my $input  = $ctx->buffer_sv (OpenCL::MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR, pack "f*", 1, 2, 3, 4.5);
       my $output = $ctx->buffer (0, OpenCL::SIZEOF_FLOAT * 5);

       # set buffer
       $kernel->set_buffer (0, $input);
       $kernel->set_buffer (1, $output);

       # execute it for all 4 numbers
       $queue->enqueue_nd_range_kernel ($kernel, undef, [4], undef);

       # enqueue a synchronous read
       $queue->enqueue_read_buffer ($output, 1, 0, OpenCL::SIZEOF_FLOAT * 4, my $data);

       # print the results:
       printf "%s\n", join ", ", unpack "f*", $data;

  The same enqueue operations as before, but assuming an out-of-order queue,
showing off barriers.
       # execute it for all 4 numbers
       $queue->enqueue_nd_range_kernel ($kernel, undef, [4], undef);

       # enqueue a barrier to ensure in-order execution
       $queue->enqueue_barrier;

       # enqueue an async read
       $queue->enqueue_read_buffer ($output, 0, 0, OpenCL::SIZEOF_FLOAT * 4, my $data);

       # wait for all requests to finish
       $queue->finish;

  The same enqueue operations as before, but assuming an out-of-order queue,
showing off event objects and wait lists.
       # execute it for all 4 numbers
       my $ev = $queue->enqueue_nd_range_kernel ($kernel, undef, [4], undef);

       # enqueue an async read
       $ev = $queue->enqueue_read_buffer ($output, 0, 0, OpenCL::SIZEOF_FLOAT * 4, my $data, $ev);

       # wait for the last event to complete
       $ev->wait;

  Use the OpenGL module to share a texture between OpenCL and OpenGL and draw some julia
set tunnel effect.
    This is quite a long example to get you going.

       use OpenGL ":all";
       use OpenCL;

       # open a window and create a gl texture
       OpenGL::glpOpenWindow width => 256, height => 256;
       my $texid = glGenTextures_p 1;
       glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, $texid;
       glTexImage2D_c GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA8, 256, 256, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 0;

       # find and use the first opencl device that let's us get a shared opengl context
       my $platform;
       my $dev;
       my $ctx;

       for (OpenCL::platforms) {
          $platform = $_;
          for ($platform->devices) {
             $dev = $_;
             $ctx = $platform->context ([OpenCL::GLX_DISPLAY_KHR, undef, OpenCL::GL_CONTEXT_KHR, undef], [$dev])
                and last;
          }
       }

       $ctx
          or die "cannot find suitable OpenCL device\n";

       my $queue = $ctx->queue ($dev);

       # now attach an opencl image2d object to the opengl texture
       my $tex = $ctx->gl_texture2d (OpenCL::MEM_WRITE_ONLY, GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, $texid);

       # now the boring opencl code
       my $src = <<EOF;
       kernel void
       juliatunnel (write_only image2d_t img, float time)
       {
         float2 p = (float2)(get_global_id (0), get_global_id (1)) / 256.f * 2.f - 1.f;

         float2 m = (float2)(1.f, p.y) / fabs (p.x);
         m.x = fabs (fmod (m.x + time * 0.05f, 4.f)) - 2.f;

         float2 z = m;
         float2 c = (float2)(sin (time * 0.05005), cos (time * 0.06001));

         for (int i = 0; i < 25 && dot (z, z) < 4.f; ++i)
           z = (float2)(z.x * z.x - z.y * z.y, 2.f * z.x * z.y) + c;

         float3 colour = (float3)(z.x, z.y, z.x * z.y);
         write_imagef (img, (int2)(get_global_id (0), get_global_id (1)), (float4)(colour * p.x * p.x, 1.));
       }
       EOF
       my $prog = $ctx->program_with_source ($src);

DOCUMENTATION
  BASIC CONVENTIONS
    This is not a one-to-one C-style translation of OpenCL to Perl - instead
    I attempted to make the interface as type-safe as possible by
    introducing object syntax where it makes sense. There are a number of
    important differences between the OpenCL C API and this module:

    *   Object lifetime managament is automatic - there is no need to free
        objects explicitly ("clReleaseXXX"), the release function is called
        automatically once all Perl references to it go away.

    *   OpenCL uses CamelCase for function names (e.g. "clGetPlatformIDs",
        "clGetPlatformInfo"), while this module uses underscores as word
        separator and often leaves out prefixes ("OpenCL::platforms",
        "$platform->info").

    *   OpenCL often specifies fixed vector function arguments as short
        arrays ("size_t origin[3]"), while this module explicitly expects
        the components as separate arguments ("$orig_x, $orig_y, $orig_z")
        in function calls.

    *   Structures are often specified by flattening out their components as
        with short vectors, and returned as arrayrefs.

    *   When enqueuing commands, the wait list is specified by adding extra
        arguments to the function - anywhere a "$wait_events..." argument is
        documented this can be any number of event objects.

    *   When enqueuing commands, if the enqueue method is called in void
        context, no event is created. In all other contexts an event is
        returned by the method.

    *   This module expects all functions to return "CL_SUCCESS". If any
        other status is returned the function will throw an exception, so
        you don't normally have to to any error checking.

  PERL AND OPENCL TYPES
    This handy(?) table lists OpenCL types and their perl, PDL and
    pack/unpack format equivalents:

       OpenCL    perl   PDL       pack/unpack
       char      IV     -         c
       uchar     IV     byte      C
       short     IV     short     s
       ushort    IV     ushort    S
       int       IV     long?     l
       uint      IV     -         L
       long      IV     longlong  q
       ulong     IV     -         Q
       float     NV     float     f
       half      IV     ushort    S
       double    NV     double    d

  GLX SUPPORT
    Due to the sad state that OpenGL support is in in Perl (mostly the
    OpenGL module, which has little to no documentation and has little to no
    support for glX), this module, as a special extension, treats context
    creation properties "OpenCL::GLX_DISPLAY_KHR" and
    "OpenCL::GL_CONTEXT_KHR" specially: If either or both of these are
    "undef", then the OpenCL module tries to dynamically resolve
    "glXGetCurrentDisplay" and "glXGetCurrentContext", call these functions
    and use their return values instead.

    For this to work, the OpenGL library must be loaded, a GLX context must
    have been created and be made current, and "dlsym" must be available and
    capable of finding the function via "RTLD_DEFAULT".

  THE OpenCL PACKAGE
    $int = OpenCL::errno
        The last error returned by a function - it's only valid after an
        error occured and before calling another OpenCL function.

    $str = OpenCL::err2str $errval
        Comverts an error value into a human readable string.

    $str = OpenCL::enum2str $enum
        Converts most enum values (of parameter names, image format
        constants, object types, addressing and filter modes, command types
        etc.) into a human readable string. When confronted with some random
        integer it can be very helpful to pass it through this function to
        maybe get some readable string out of it.

    @platforms = OpenCL::platforms
        Returns all available OpenCL::Platform objects.

        <http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.1/docs/man/xhtml/clGetPlat
        formIDs.html>

    $ctx = OpenCL::context_from_type $properties, $type =
    OpenCL::DEVICE_TYPE_DEFAULT, $notify = undef
        Tries to create a context from a default device and platform - never
        worked for me.

        <http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.1/docs/man/xhtml/clCreateC
        ontextFromType.html>

    OpenCL::wait_for_events $wait_events...
        Waits for all events to complete.

        <http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.1/docs/man/xhtml/clWaitFor
        Events.html>

  THE OpenCL::Platform CLASS
    @devices = $platform->devices ($type = OpenCL::DEVICE_TYPE_ALL)
        Returns a list of matching OpenCL::Device objects.

    $ctx = $platform->context_from_type ($properties, $type =
    OpenCL::DEVICE_TYPE_DEFAULT, $notify = undef)
        Tries to create a context. Never worked for me, and you need devices
        explicitly anyway.

        <http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.1/docs/man/xhtml/clCreateC
        ontextFromType.html>

    $ctx = $platform->context ($properties = undef, @$devices, $notify =
    undef)
        Create a new OpenCL::Context object using the given device
        object(s)- a CL_CONTEXT_PLATFORM property is supplied automatically.

        <http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.1/docs/man/xhtml/clCreateC
        ontext.html>

    $packed_value = $platform->info ($name)
        Calls "clGetPlatformInfo" and returns the packed, raw value - for
        strings, this will be the string (possibly including terminating
        \0), for other values you probably need to use the correct "unpack".

        It's best to avoid this method and use one of the following
        convenience wrappers.

        <http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.1/docs/man/xhtml/clGetPlat
        formInfo.html>

    $string = $platform->profile
        Calls "clGetPlatformInfo" with "CL_PLATFORM_PROFILE" and returns the
        result.

    $string = $platform->version
        Calls "clGetPlatformInfo" with "CL_PLATFORM_VERSION" and returns the
        result.

        result.

  THE OpenCL::Queue CLASS
    An OpenCL::Queue represents an execution queue for OpenCL. You execute
    requests by calling their respective "enqueue_xxx" method and waitinf
    for it to complete in some way.

    All the enqueue methods return an event object that can be used to wait
    for completion, unless the method is called in void context, in which
    case no event object is created.

    They also allow you to specify any number of other event objects that
    this request has to wait for before it starts executing, by simply
    passing the event objects as extra parameters to the enqueue methods.

    Queues execute in-order by default, without any parallelism, so in most
    cases (i.e. you use only one queue) it's not necessary to wait for or
    create event objects.

    $ev = $queue->enqueue_read_buffer ($buffer, $blocking, $offset, $len,
    $data, $wait_events...)

  THE OpenCL::BufferObj CLASS
    This is a subclass of OpenCL::Buffer and thus OpenCL::Memory. It exists
    because one cna create sub buffers of OpenLC::BufferObj objects, but not
    sub buffers from these sub buffers.

    $subbuf = $buf_obj->sub_buffer_region ($flags, $origin, $size)
        Creates an OpenCL::Buffer objects from this buffer and returns it.
        The "buffer_create_type" is assumed to be
        "CL_BUFFER_CREATE_TYPE_REGION".

        ubBuffer.html>

  THE OpenCL::Image CLASS
    This is the superclass of all image objects - OpenCL::Image2D and
    OpenCL::Image3D.

    $packed_value = $ev->image_info ($name)
        See "$platform->info" for details.

        The reason this method is not called "info" is that there already is
        an "->info" method inherited from "OpenCL::Memory".
