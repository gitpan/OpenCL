Revision history for Perl extension OpenCL.

0.14
	- major incompatibilities due to API cleanup, the AI should now be
          mostly stable, if incomplete.
	- fix prerequisites.
	- replaced all _simple functions by "full" implementations, with some
          parameters marked for future expansion - that means their API
          should be stable from now on:
             OpenCL::context_from_type_simple    => OpenCL::context_from_type
             $platform->context_from_type_simple => $platform->context_from_type
             $dev->context_simple                => $platform->context
             $ctx->command_queue_simple became   => $ctx->queue
        - add OpenCL::context function.
        - officially require C99.
        - errno value is unspecified after a successful call.
